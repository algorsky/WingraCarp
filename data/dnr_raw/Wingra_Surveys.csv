THIS WAS THE RECAPTURE SURVEY TO DETERMINE ABUNDANCE OF MUSKY IN LAKE WINGRA.     ALL MUSKY LARGE ENOUGH ARE TAGGED WITH A LEFT OPERCLE TAG.  ALL MUSKY ALSO RECIEVE A TOP CAUDAL FIN CLIP.  OTHER GAMEFISH ARE ALSO GIVEN A TC.  UNTAGGED MUSKY ALSO RECIEVED A TAG.    IN THE SUB SAMPLE LENGTH-AGE DATA, FISH THAT WERE PARTIALLY SPENT WERE CONSIDERED RIPE, AS PARTIALLY SPENT WASNT AN OPTION.  ALSO, DURING NETTING, SOME FISH WERE RE-TAGGED, SO THE RECORD WILL SHOW NOTHING FOR MARK GIVEN, BUT IN THOSE CASES WILL HAVE A NUMBER UNDER BOTH MARK GIVEN AND MARK FOUND.  NET 5 WAS MOVED FROM EDGEWOOD(5A) TO EAST SHORE (5B) AFTER FIRST 3 NIGHTS.  NET 1 WAS MOVED FROM SOUTHWEST SHORE (1) TO SOUTHWEST SHORE (1B) AFTER FIRST 3 NIGHTS.  ON 04-09-05 THE SCALE WAS NOT PROPERLY ZEROED SO WEIGHTS ARE LIKELY NOT ACCURATE AND NOT ENTERED",NA,NA,NA
